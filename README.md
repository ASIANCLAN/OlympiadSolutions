# Olympiad Solutions

This repository contains solutions to a plethora of algorithmic problems that come mainly from 3 online judges:

* [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/) - 400+ problems
* [SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/) - 200+ problems
* [URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/pt) - 850+ problems

Most solutions were coded between Mid 2016 and Late 2018. They were inteded as a training for the [Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics](https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/) and the [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://ioinformatics.org/index.shtml). These solutions might be helpful to future competitors, so I am sharing them as a form of reference.

Brief summary of my Olympiad in Informatics story :

I participated twice in the Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics : I won gold medals in [2017](https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/passadas/OBI2017/qmerito/p2/) and [2016](https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/passadas/OBI2016/qmerito/p2/).

I represented Brazil at the 30th International Olympiad in Informatics held at Tsukuba, Japan. I ranked [171st](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/6465) among 335 competitors.
